**Hear** the word of the Lord, <br>
all you men of Judah who enter these **gates** <br>
to **worship** the Lord.

**Amend** your **ways** and your **deeds**, <br>
and I will let you dwell in this place.

Do not trust in these **deceptive** words: 

‘This is the **temple** of the Lord, <br>
the temple of the Lord, <br>
the temple of the Lord.’

[Jeremiah 7:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

“For if you truly amend <br>
your ways and your deeds, <br>
if you truly execute **justice** one with another, <br>
if you do not **oppress** the sojourner, <br>
the fatherless, or the widow, <br>
or shed **innocent blood** in this place, <br>
and if you do not go after **other gods** <br>
to your own harm,

then I will let you **dwell** in this place, <br>
in the land that I gave of old <br>
to your fathers forever.

[Jeremiah 7:7 (ESV)](# "ref")

“Behold, you trust in deceptive words <br>
to no avail. 

Will you **steal**, **murder**, commit **adultery**, <br>
swear **falsely**, make offerings to **Baal**, and <br>
go after **other gods** that you have not known, 

[Jeremiah 7:8-9 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
and then come and stand before me <br>
in this house, which is called by my name, <br>
and say, ‘We are **delivered**!’ --<br>
only to go on doing all these **abominations**?

[Jeremiah 7:10 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
Has this house, which is called by my name,<br>
become a **den of robbers** in your eyes?

Behold, I myself have **seen** it,<br>
declares the Lord.

[Jeremiah 7:11 (ESV)](# "ref")
